This code takes in the file 'parks' and converts it to the numbers 
on a phone that you would push if you were trying to text that word.
It compares the numeric equivalent of the word to the set of 
numbers we already have (in masternums).  To render the print
statements correctly, you will want to use Python3.  

The set of numbers in masternums came from finding clues in the 
Prairie Fest Medallion Hunt at local parks.  We only found 3
of the 5 clues, so we do not have the entire list of numbers
in masternums.  For this reason, we calculate a partial match.

The sixth clue seems to tell us to take the numbers found in 
clues 1-5 and determine which park name those numbers spell
on a phone keypad.  

The clues at http://www.prairiefest.com/clues.htm took us to 
locations around town where we found a paper with a set of
numbers (which are in masternums).

You can change the input file ('parks') and the list of numbers
in masternums, for example, to see what other words in a file 
can be partially constructed from a list of numbers of your choice.
